The current project is a website that shows many different food recipes on the front pages, with links accompanying them to direct you to the recipe itself. 

The skills I will learn and demonstrate through this project is creating a website with html, creating a main page (index.html), as well as seperate recipe pages for each recipe. Along with this, it will also reinforce link embedding and general html formatting.
